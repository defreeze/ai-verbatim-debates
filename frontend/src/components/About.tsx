              Our AI debaters implement the methodology from the research paper "Can LLMs Beat Humans in Debating?", 
              which introduces a dynamic multi-agent framework designed to enhance LLMs' capabilities in competitive debate:

                <h3 className="text-xl text-white mb-2">1. Information Processing</h3>
                <p>The AI acts as a Searcher agent, analyzing the debate topic and stance, gathering relevant information, 
                and identifying key arguments and potential counterpoints while avoiding hallucinations.</p>

                <p>Taking on the role of an Analyzer agent, the AI develops a debate strategy by evaluating argument 
                strength, organizing points in a logical sequence, and preparing responses to anticipated counterarguments.</p>

                <h3 className="text-xl text-white mb-2">3. Argument Construction</h3>
                <p>As a Writer agent, the AI constructs compelling arguments supported by evidence and logical reasoning, 
                ensuring coherence and persuasiveness while maintaining factual accuracy.</p>

                <h3 className="text-xl text-white mb-2">4. Dynamic Response</h3>
                <p>The AI combines Analyzer and Writer roles to process opposing arguments in real-time, 
                identify their strengths and weaknesses, and formulate effective counterarguments.</p>

                <h3 className="text-xl text-white mb-2">5. Quality Assurance</h3>
                <p>Acting as a Reviewer agent, the AI evaluates and refines its arguments, ensuring they meet 
                debate standards, maintain logical consistency, and effectively advance the overall position.</p>

            <p>
              Users can customize various aspects of the AI debaters, including their stance, 
              personality, and debate style. Advanced settings allow for fine-tuning of the model's 
              behavior and rhetorical approach.
